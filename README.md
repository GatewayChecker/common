2.0.1
Initial release

2.1.1
Add getGLN, getGS1 
Move checksum functions into BaseGtin class
Add Gtin class
Add support for getGLN to support a GS1 length of 3 through 7

2.2.1
Fixed bug where <ProcessingErrors></ProcessingErrors> tags were written out in report when no errors are actually present. 
Report was writing out <ProcessingErrors></ProcessingErrors> tags in the Event Extractor output. By default, the Event Extractor was writing out 
these outer tags even when there are no processing errors. The actual processing errors would have shown up inside these tags, if there were any.
This was a minor bug and will be fixed in the next release of Event Extractor. In theÂ this version, these tags will only be written 
out when there are actual processing errors. 
If there were actual errors, they would show up inside these outer tags. 
These ProcessingErrors tags are not for XSDValidation. They are for any processing errors that show up while processing the EPCIS data.                        
XSD Validation Errors, if there were any, would come out with bracketing XMLElements
<XSDValidationErrors></XSDValidationErrors>

Improved Error handling for SSCC. 
Added test code for SSCC
removed default UTF-8 encoding for XML document. Using default UTF-8 caused an error when
reading a file with a different encoding. 

2.10.1
7/13/23
add support for the following combinations of fdaLabelerCodeDigit and productCodeDigit in the Gtin class
4-4-2     9999-9999-99
5-3-2     99999-999-99
5-4-1     99999-9999-9

Modified the Sgtin class so we could support the  5-4-1 case in the ndc application. 
Before only 5-3-2 and 4-4-2 were supported. The sgtin was calculating the productCode from the 
second segment of the Sgtin, but there is not way to determine if it's a 5-4-1 or 5-3-2 only from
the input Sgtin.
